	<h1>Terms of the Exercise</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>The purpose is to save both candidates and ourselves from wasting time in interviews - it is therefore not in your interest to cheat.</li>
		<li>You can take as long as you like to complete the exercise, but for an indicative timescale we expect a senior developer can accomplish this in an hour.</li>
		<li>You may use online resources to assist you with specific techniques, syntax etc. but please do not just copy code.</li>
		<li><b>DO NOT</b> share this exercise with any third party - this will undermine the use of the exercise with future candidates.</li>
	</ul>
	<h1>The Challenge</h1>
	<p>
		The aim of the exercise is to demonstrate your problem solving and understanding of JavaScript by implementing something found in every unit testing tool - an "assertEquals" method.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Fill in the "assertEquals" function such that it will correctly compare "expected" vs "actual" parameters passed to it, including all the sample test data provided.</li>
		<li>You may add more functions.</li>
		<li>Credit will be given for approach, correctly identifying "failed" assertEquals, "clean" code, coding style and consideration of future requirements (i.e. how easy would your solution be to extend to more test cases).</li>
	</ul>
	<h1>Sample Test Data</h1>
	The following tests should "fail":  <strong>02, 03, 04, 07, 08 and 09</strong> - and the failures should be reported using the provided mechanism.<br/>
	The failure messages should report further information:
	<ul class="expected">
		<li>Test 02: Expected "abcdef" found "abc"</li>
		<li>Test 03: Expected type Array but found Object</li>
		<li>Test 04: Expected array length 2 but found 3</li>
		<li>Test 07: Expected propB.propA[1].propB "b" but found "c"</li>
		<li>Test 08: Expected propB.propC but was not found</li>
		<li>Test 09: Expected type null but found type Object</li>
	</ul>
